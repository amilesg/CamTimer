# CamTimer
My Android camera project that implements the self-timer feature not found in the stock camera app.

It started as a Hello-World kind of project where I thought I could just use an Intent to fire off
an image request to the camera upon expiration of a user-settable timer, but I couldn't find a way
to make the camera return an image without the user having to activate the shutter.  So instead, I
manipulate and manage the camera directly, which is more involved than a simple Intent, but I've
learned a lot more this way.

I welcome any and all comments.  Thank you!
